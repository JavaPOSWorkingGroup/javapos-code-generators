# JavaPOS Code Generators
This project implements code generators for creating JavaPOS types from JavaPOS contract interfaces.

The implementations in this project are not intended to be used in JavaPOS applications or device service implementations. They are just development and build tools for the JavaPOS library maintainers to make their job easier and smoother.

It utilizes the [Xtend](https://www.eclipse.org/xtend) language and its great code template features.
